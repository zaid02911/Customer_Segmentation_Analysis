# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Analysis (RFM Modeling)

![Customer Segment Visualization](Customer_Segments.png)

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This **AI-powered RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis engine** transforms raw transaction data into strategic customer segments. Designed for data-driven marketing teams, it answers three critical questions:

1. **Who are your most valuable customers?**  
   - Identify 🏆 **Champions** (high recency + frequency + spending)
2. **Who is slipping away?**  
   - Flag ⚠️ **At-Risk** customers (declining engagement)  
3. **Where are hidden growth opportunities?**  
   - Discover 💎 **Potential Loyalists** (emerging high-value segments)
